## Adeptmind frontend test
There are two parts in the Adeptmind frontend test. The first part is to style a profile page using vanilla CSS and HTML, and the second part is to answer two JavaScript questions.

## Part 1

### Profile Styling
The first is to style a profile page (`profile-styling.html`) to match the provided design (`profile-styling-finished.png`).

##### Requirements
- Match the final design as closely as possible (see `profile-styling-finished.png` for what it should look like).
- Add hover effects to the navigation in the header and footer.
- Use only html and css
- Specific styles can be found in the `html` file.
- Images used are provided in the `images` directory
- Write vanilla css within `style` tags in the `head`
- Use any css or html that works in the latest Chrome (no other browsers will be tested)
- It will be evaluated on a 15" Macbook Pro on Chrome
- Style only a Desktop version
- Create a "sticky footer" so regardless of the content, the footer is stuck to the bottom of the content

## Part 2
Answer one or both of the javascript questions. (see the `javascript-questions` directory). All the information on how to answer the questions can be found within the `question.js` files.
